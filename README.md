# Stock Ticker - Team Genesis - Project 01

## Description

This project was to build a web app that will allow the user to have information on stocks at their finger tips. The app will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. It will use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

```md
The app should operate within the following requirements:
1. The user can search a stock ticker and be shown:
    * Detailed stock information for the entered stock ticker.
    * A favorites panel showing info for the favorite stocks.
    * News for the stock ticker selected
2. The block that displays the detailed stock information should show:
    * the stock symbol
    * the currency for information 
    * the high stock price 
    * today's opening stock price
3. The block that displays stock favorites should show:
    * the stock symbol
    * percentage change
    * buttons to allow:
        * show stock info
        * show news
        * delete from favorites
4. Searched City History will be displayed
    * When the user clicks on a city in the Searched City History the current and 5-day forecast for that city should be displayed.
    * Cities should be listed alphabetically and only once in the Searched City History
5.  The searched stock ticker entered should be:
    * Capitalized appropriately
    * Prompted for corrections for entries that aren't valid ticker symbols
    * Also display news in the news section
```
