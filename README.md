# Stock Ticker - Team Genesis - Project 01

## Description

This project was to build a web app that will allow the user to have information on stocks at their finger tips. The app will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. It will use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

```md
The app should operate within the following requirements:
1. The user can search a city and be shown:
    * Current weather conditions for that city.
    * A 5-day forecast for that city.
2. The block that displays the current weather conditions should show:
    * the city name 
    * the date 
    * an icon representation of weather conditions 
    * the temperature
    * the humidity
    * the wind speed
    * the UV index
        * presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
3. The block that displays the 5-day forecast should show:
    * the date
    * an icon representation of weather conditions
    * the temperature
    * the humidity
4. Searched City History will be displayed
    * When the user clicks on a city in the Searched City History the current and 5-day forecast for that city should be displayed.
    * Cities should be listed alphabetically and only once in the Searched City History
5.  The search city entered should be:
    * Capitalized appropriately
    * Prompted for corrections for entries that don't return weather
    * Displayed in the Searched City History
```
